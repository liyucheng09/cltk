Welcome to CLTK (Creative Linguage Toolkit), an open source project that provides a one-stop toolkit for creative language processing. 

CLTK offers a comprehensive API for accessing creative language datasets and includes pre-trained models for creative language detection, interpretation, and generation. This projects includes metaphors, sarcasm, irony, simile, idiom and more types of creative language.

## Datasets

We collect all available data resources for creative language processing and format them as Huggingface Datasets, so that you can access and use them directly.

Now CLTK has collected the following datasets:

**Metaphor:**
- VUA20 (FigLang@ACL 2020)
- TroFi (EACL 2006)
- MOH (SEM 2016)
- Chinese_Metaphor_Corpus (CMC, COLING 2022)
- UKP_Novel_Metaphor (EMNLP 2018)

**Humor:**
- ColBERT

**Simile:**
- Scope (EMNLP 2020)
- WPS_Chinese_Simile (AAAI 2020)

Open an issue if you hope any dataset to be included in CLTK.
